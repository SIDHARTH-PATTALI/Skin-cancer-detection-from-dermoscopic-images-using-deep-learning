# Skin-cancer-detection-from-dermoscopic-images-using-deep-learning
This project implements a skin cancer detection and classification system using deep learning techniques. It utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained models like AlexNet and ResNet50, along with clustering for image segmentation&amp;The MATLAB GUI allows users to upload an image, analyze and display.
